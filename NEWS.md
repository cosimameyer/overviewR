We fixed the following bugs:
- Fixed bug in overview_plot function
   - Time line was not correctly displayed when a consecutive time variable was present for two different id variables
- Fixed bug in vignette
   - Loaded package dplyr to follow CRAN policies: "Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error). CRAN versions of packages should work with the current CRAN and Bioconductor releases of packages they depend on and not anticipate nor recommend development versions of such packages (or themselves) on other repositories."

And added the following new features:
- Added function for overview_plot function
   - Y axis is now automatically ordered in ascending order
